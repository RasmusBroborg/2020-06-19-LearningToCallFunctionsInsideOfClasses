A repo for all python coding challenges that are not part of any specific project.

https://edabit.com/challenge/YfoKQWNeYETb9PYpw

Task: Calculate the Profit You work for a manufacturer, and have been asked to calculate the total profit made on the sales of a product. You are given a dictionary containing the cost price per unit (in dollars), sell price per unit (in dollars), and the starting inventory. Return the total profit made, rounded to the nearest dollar. Assume all of the inventory has been sold.



* Circle-And-Two-Squares

Medium difficulty coding challenge from https://edabit.com/challenge/NNhkGocuPMcryW7GP

Imagine a circle and two squares: a smaller and a bigger one. For the smaller one, the circle is a circumcircle and for the bigger one, an incircle.

Create a function, that takes an integer (radius of the circle) and returns the area of the square inside the circle.

Examples square_areas_difference(5) ➞ 50 square_areas_difference(6) ➞ 72 square_areas_difference(7) ➞ 98.

Notes Use only positive integer parameters.



* FizzBuzzInterviewQuestion

Medium difficulty coding challenge https://edabit.com/challenge/WXqH9qvvGkmx4dMvp

Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz".

If the number is a multiple of 3 the output should be "Fizz". If the number given is a multiple of 5, the output should be "Buzz". If the number given is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the output should be "FizzBuzz". If the number is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, the number should be output on its own as shown in the examples below. The output should always be a string even if it is not a multiple of 3 or 5

Examples fizz_buzz(3) ➞ "Fizz" fizz_buzz(5) ➞ "Buzz" fizz_buzz(15) ➞ "FizzBuzz" fizz_buzz(4) ➞ "4"

Notes Try to be precise with how you spell things and where you put the capital letters.



* NumeralSystemToDecimal

Converting different numeral systems numbers to decimal.

This is a continuation of the repository "2020-06-15-Binary-To-Decimals". The function returns the decimal value for the value of whatever numeral system it is based on as long as the base is specified.



* Shuffled-Name

Create a function that takes a string (will be a person's first and last name) and returns a string with the first and last name swapped.

Examples: name_shuffle("Donald Trump") ➞ "Trump Donald" name_shuffle("Rosie O'Donnell") ➞ "O'Donnell Rosie" name_shuffle("Seymour Butts") ➞ "Butts Seymour" Notes There will be exactly one space between the first and last name.
