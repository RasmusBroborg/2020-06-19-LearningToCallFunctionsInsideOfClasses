The purpose of the repository is to have a place to test out coding ideas on a
smaller scale.

I quickly found that creating individual repositories for each coding idea
resulted in a large quantity of small projects or unfinished projects that I was
unable to progress on because of lack of knowledge.

Instead of having a bloated number of repositories this repository contains mini
projects, coding challenges, general ideas, and code from following tutorials.
