The purpose of the repository is to have a place to test out coding ideas and concepts whilst I am learning python programming.



Main folders:

    - /python-tests/coding_challenges
        Folder containing python files that are linked to coding challenges found on various websites and such.


    - /python-tests/miniprojects
        Folder containing smaller projects that are not large enough to be own repositories.


    - /python-tests/tutorials
        Folder containing files that are directly linked to specific guides and tutorials found online.



Descriptions of the various mini projects in /python-tests/miniprojects:

    - /general_tests
        general_tests is an empty project where I can test code in an enclosed environment before implementation in the codes
        intended mini project.


    - /tictactoe
        An attempt to build tictactoe without using any guide/reference code.

        - tictactoe_v01.py
            The first attempt at the game, using pygame to draw the display. Initial idea was to have most of the games logic be built
            as methods of the Board()-class, but as some of the games logic was built as functions outside of the class the final code
            got rather messy and difficult to understand.
        - tictactoe_v02.py
            The second attempt to create tictactoe, created to simplify the game logic to increase readability and ability to scale
            with resolution size of the board.
